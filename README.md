It is a messanger that can talk or discuss with.
you can take part in a discussion like social problem, hot issue or chat with your friends as usual.

It has two kinds of chat mode named 'Public', 'Secret'.

'Public' mode is standard chatting which messages are protected from a server.

'Secret' mode doesn't save any history talk with.

Every users will be assigned 'Level' which describes activity ratio which implies your "Ratio of contact", "Participation rate about any discussion or topic".

So it will have an effect on closing anonymous users as well as chatting with my friends as you do activities.
